# Smarter Data Collection for Microsoft Civic Graph

In an effort to make Civic Graph a little bit smarter, I developed four building blocks to help improve the quality (i.e. accuracy, completeness) of the data stored as well as automate aspects of the data collection process. They are:

* Web Scrapers
* Analytics Toolbox
* Classifier
* Pipeline to integrate scrapers, classifier, analysis with existing Civic Graph
