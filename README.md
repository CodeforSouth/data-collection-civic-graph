# Smarter Data Collection for Microsoft Civic Graph
#### By Hannah Cutler

In an effort to make [Civic Graph](http://civicgraph.io) a little bit smarter, I developed four building blocks to help improve the quality (i.e. accuracy, completeness) of the data stored as well as automate aspects of the data collection process. They are:

* __Web Scrapers__
* __Analytics Toolbox__
* __Classifier__
* [__Pipeline__](/References/Pipeline Diagram.pdf) to integrate *scrapers*, *classifier*, and *analysis* with existing Civic Graph
